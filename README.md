# N-puzzle Game

This is a classic 15-puzzle where the objective is to arrange all the bricks in numerical order, leaving the empty slot in the bottom right corner.

User can change the number of rows and columns using range sliders. To adjust the min and max value of rows/columns you can modify RowsColumnsChanger.jsx file by changing `min` and `max` value in `<input>` elements.
